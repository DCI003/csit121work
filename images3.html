        <h3>Welcome to my page about Soccer</h3>
        <p>I love soccer because growing up, it was the only sport I could play and I was very good at it</p>
        <h4>Why did you pick this GIF?</h4>
        <p>I had picked this gif because when playing soocer, you have a passion for the game. You either love it, or you hate it, but something would never change
            and that is your sport team that you would grow up watching. I also played soccer in middle school going into high school (Yes i was good at it).</p>
