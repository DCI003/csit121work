                        My first webpage! At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many tags
                        and structures to remember, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.
                        Learning how to properly structure an HTML helped me understand how webpages are
                        built and displayed.

                    <h3>
                        What I learned
                    </h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> a thing I learned</li>
                        <li>another thing I learned</li>
                        <li>so many things!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Learning about x, y, and z was was another exciting step. I learned a lot from:
                    </p>

                        <li><a href="this page"> this page</a></li>
                        <li><a href="and this page">and this page</a></li>
