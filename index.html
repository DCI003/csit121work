                        My first webpage! At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many tags
                        and structures to remember, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.
                        Learning how to properly structure an HTML helped me understand how webpages are
                        built and displayed.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        What I learned
                    </h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> a thing I learned</li>
                        <li>another thing I learned</li>
                        <li>so many things!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Learning about x, y, and z was was another exciting step. I learned a lot from:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="this page"> this page</a></li>
                        <li><a href="and this page">and this page</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This week, we learnt about CSS and how to use it to style the color of our website.
                        I have been able to learn how to correctly style my website using what ever color i want
                        and how to correctly link a file to a different file for my website. I was also able to change
                        what type of font i want to use, and I am about to add id to my lab 3.</p>
