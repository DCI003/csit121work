        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            When ranking my favorite snacks, I had to think what types of snacks I loved. I had to check my list in other to find
            different types of snacks I buy alot when i am at the groccery store. Ranking these was also fun because I also had to
            skip out on alot of different other snacks that I love to eat, like nuts, but i had to put potato chips on S because 
            every since I was young, potato chips were everything to me. Before submiting this, I was having trouble with the stylesheet
            not showing up, so I had to redo everything and it still was not showing. So, I had to look at the spelling, and that was what
            was missing, I was able to add the stylesheet in (Learned from my mistake to always check my spelling no matter what).
