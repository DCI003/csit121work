            <h2>Wat is DOM?</h2>
            <p>DOM also known as The COument Object Model is  programming for web documents thatrepresents the page structure
                as a tree of the object such as element, attribute or text. </p>
            <p>It serves as a bridge for scripting languages like JavaScript which allows access to different structures and styles in a web page.</p>
            <p>You can think of DOM as a blueprint that is organized in a hierarchical way.</p>
