        <h2>10. Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h2>

            search for something, the product would have a picture in the search bar with the product name, if Walmart search engine can do that, 
            it would be very good.</p>

    <p>This week, I learnt how to evaulate a wesbite based of its home page. I made an evaluation of walmart because I use walmart alot for shopping and it has some cheaper options
        for most of the items I need based on the sales. I was able also able to add the screenshot of the website i was talking about because a few assigments ago, i was not able to
        add screenshots and when i thought i did, it would not show the image. I also learned about website organzation and see the similar and difference in many websites. I also learned
        about the Hierarchical organzation and their key points when it comes to navigating websites.
