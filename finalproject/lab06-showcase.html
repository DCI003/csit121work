            <h1>Showcase: Lab 06 - Website</h1>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This lab involved evaluating a website of my choosing. Once I had picked the website, I have to make note of 
                it like how is the site organzied, What is the site's efficiency and Can users perform tasks quickly using
                the website. I had picked walmart because it was the first wesbite that came to mind because of how different
                it is from other sites like Amazon and Sam's club. I also had to make note of the Hierarchical Organization based of its
                web developments and search engine optimization.</p>
