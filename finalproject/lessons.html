        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <h2>Reflection on the Final Project</h2>
        <p>Before I first started working on my final project, I had trouble because I did not know where to start
            from. It was hard at first but I had to go back to the video on Monday on the class recording to see how
            and where to at least get started on. Had to read the requirement again to know what I need to touch on
            in case I had missed anything.</p>
        <h2>Browser and Device Testing</h2>
        <p>Sometimes after I have published the code on github, and I try to run the page through google chrome, I would
            get an error saying that the page itself that I am going to is a virus and it was blocked, even though I have
            been on it in less than 5 seconds. But when I am using the web browser Brave, I would get the same thing but I
            would need to reload or hit the go back button and it would show me what my page looks like after I have published
            it thorugh github.
        </p>
        <h2>Overall Course Reflection</h2>
        <p>I learned alot this semester that includes using CSS styles, how to link a file, how to use html and how to
            add images into a code. I did struggle at first, but towards the end, I had learned alot using visual stuido
            code and I know in the future, I would need it some day.
