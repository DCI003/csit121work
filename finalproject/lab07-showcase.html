        <h1>Showcase: Lab 07 - Tier List</h1>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This lab involved creating a tier list layout using HTML and CSS of my favorite snack brand. I had to pick my top 5 and rank them
            from best to least. It was fun because we had to use a different type of html like creating tables, learning a new html style like thread and tb (for tables).
            I had to also create a contact list for the people checking out my page to contact me if they feel like my list was not good and needed to change things.  </p>
